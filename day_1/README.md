# Day 1 Goals

Welcome to Day 1 of the DSA Coding Challenge!

## Today's Goals (Arrays):

- Learn Big O Analysis to find Time and Space complexity
- Array Data Structure Crash Course

### Question 1: Sorted Squared Array

You are given an array of integers in which each subsequent value is not less than the previous value. Write a function that takes this array as an input and returns a new array with the squares of each number sorted in ascending order.

### Question 2: Monotonic Array

An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing. An array is monotone increasing if all its elements from left to right are non-decreasing. An array is monotone decreasing if all its elements from left to right are non-increasing. Given an integer array, return true if the given array is monotonic, or false otherwise.

All the best!
